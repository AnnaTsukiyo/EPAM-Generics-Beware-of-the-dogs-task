# Beware of dogs

Use generics to change [`House`](src/main/java/com/epam/rd/autotasks/house/House.java) class in order to dogs cannot enter cats' house and cats cannot enter dogs' house. 

You need to alter `residents` field and `enter` methods of the `House` class.

Note that if you have done everything right, then two particular lines in the [`Main`](src/main/java/com/epam/rd/autotasks/house/Main.java) class will prevent successful compilation, so you need to remove them.
See details in the `Main` class.
